<h1>Class Task</h1>

Here we have the methods that the Task class should implement.

## getTaskById ##

> Needed to get the task's ID. Should be able to handle it by finding the first number after each newline (\n) char.
> Note: if  `taskId % 100 = 0`  , we need not check for any more information other than the name and its MamaId.

## getTaskName ##

> Needed to get the task's name. Should be implemented by getting the first tab (\t) char and ending in the second one.
